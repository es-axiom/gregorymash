    "The woods are a safe place. They are tended to by a voiceless shadow, a wanderer of the land between the trails. Ever see a print you couldn't place? A footprint a bit larger than life? A glimpse of a figure between the trees? Be thankful for what it provides.",
    "It watches how you ride and traverse the trails, hungry for wheelies and whips - will you catch a gaze between the trees?"
