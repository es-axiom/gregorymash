        The woods are a safe place. They are tended to by a voiceless shadow, a
        wanderer of the land between the trails. Ever see a print you couldn't
        place? A footprint a bit larger than life? A glimpse of a figure between
        the trees? Be thankful for what it provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        It watches how you ride and traverse the trails, hungry for wheelies and
        whips - will you catch a gaze between the trees?
