        The woods are a safe place. They are tended to by a voiceless shadow, a
        wanderer of the land between the trails. Ever see a print you couldn't
        place? A footprint a bit larger than life? A glimpse of a figure between
        the trees while at speed? Be thankful for what it provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        It needs not introduce itself - but it can be found. Will you be the one
        to do it?
